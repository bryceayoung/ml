This repository contains assignments from a machine learning course at the University of Montana. All code was written by the author. 

Assignments include: 
- a1: matrix multiplication 
- a2: KNN, regression, and classification 
- a3: Logistic regression, minimizing loss through gradient descent, and performance eval through ROC curves and cross validation
- a4: Neural networks development, implementation, and tuning hyperparameters
- a5: Clustering techniques, dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE on diverse, real-world datasets
- kaggle: training and testing models to find the best fit to arbitraty data (I scored top marks on this with GLM)
- RandomForest: predicting wildfire risk scores from single-building parcel records (final assignment)
